## What is Hacktoberfest? ðŸŽ‡

Hacktoberfest is a month long celebration of open source software held in the month of October to get people involved in <strong>open-source</strong>. This year's edition is presented by <a target="_blank" href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>.

## Rules

To get a T-shirt, you must make four pull requests between October 1â€“31 in any timezone. Pull requests can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones weâ€™ve highlighted. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. Make a pull request to only those repositories which have Hacktoberfest tag on it.
