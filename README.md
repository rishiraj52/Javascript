## What is Hacktoberfest? 🎇

Hacktoberfest is a month long celebration of open source software held in the month of October to get people involved in <strong>open-source</strong>. This year's edition is presented by <a target="_blank" href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>.

<br>

## Rules

To get a T-shirt, you must make four pull requests between October 1–31 in any timezone. Pull requests can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones we’ve highlighted. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. Make a pull request to only those repositories which have Hacktoberfest tag on it.
