CODE OF CONDUCT

Be nice. No harassment, trolling, or spamming.
Harassment includes sexual language and imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, name-calling, unwelcome attention, libel, and any malicious hacking or social engineering. freeCodeCamp should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, national origin, or religion (or lack thereof).
Trolling includes posting inflammatory comments to provoke an emotional response or disrupt discussions.
Spamming includes posting off-topic messages to disrupt discussions, promote a product, solicit donations, advertise a job / internship / gig, or flooding discussions with files or text.

Open Pull Requests
Once you’ve opened a pull request, a discussion will start around your proposed changes.
Other contributors and users may chime in, but ultimately the decision is made by the collaborators.
During the discussion, you may be asked to make some changes to your pull request.
If so, add more commits to your branch and push them – they will automatically go into the existing pull request. But don't forget to squash them.
Thanks for being a part of this project, and we look forward to hearing from you soon!
